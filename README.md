Developing a portfolio art and design site.
Hello, I am in the process of developing my portfolio site and learning to use GitHub at the same time. So I will initally only post code in sections.
Some of the things I am looking to fix are my old and outdated slider, proper respoinsiveness and just general newbie issues.
Feel free to make changes and suggestion and I appreciate any feedback you may give.

Thank you,
